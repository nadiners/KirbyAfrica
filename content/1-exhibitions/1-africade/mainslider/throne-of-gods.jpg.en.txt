Caption: Throne of Gods is an epic fighting game, made for mobile devices and based on African mythology. In its artistic style, character design and gameplay, it is inspired by classic generic titles such as Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat and Killer Instinct.  It adds a twist, though, by introducing a more casual, touch-screen native control scheme, and by using characters based on gods and deities from regions as diverse as Africa can be – Ghana, Mali, Ivory Coast, Angola and Nigeria. The creative duo behind the game hopes to showcase and raise awareness of the magic of African myths, and plans to further develop the characters as the game progresses.
