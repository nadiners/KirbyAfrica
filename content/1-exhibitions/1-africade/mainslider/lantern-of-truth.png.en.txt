Lantern of Truth is a puzzle game where players assume the role of the Grim Reaper. Magical lamps are used in order to bring objects from an alternate dimension into life.
Created within 48 hours and winner of the #gamezanga 2016 competition, Lantern of Truth is a perfect example of the game jam culture: a concise study into mechanics that challenge the players to engage with a specific theme. The 2016 gamezanga theme was Iillusion, which manifests in the titular lamps of this bright little game.
