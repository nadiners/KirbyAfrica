The mechanics of After Robot is based on the minibus taxi that dominates the urban landscape in the home country of its designers. The game’s name is derived from the passengers’ common instruction to the taxi driver to stop after the traffic light, which most South Africans refer to as robot. The game places players in the perspective of South African minibus taxi operators, inviting them to share the stressful routine of taxi drivers. After Robot does not make any comment about the taxi industry: it is simply a platform for people to act out what they think of the service’s hardships and business challenges. 
I started making the game at a time when I was taking a lot of taxis and realized that a lot of South Africans had very bad things to say about an industry that transports over 70% of the low- to middle-class workers. Most of the negativity comes from people that do not use this service. So I made the game to place the players in a situation where they would face the same pressures that taxi drivers face on a daily basis.
