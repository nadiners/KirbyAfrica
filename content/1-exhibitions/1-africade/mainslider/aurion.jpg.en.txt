Aurion is a fantasy action game that draws upon African mythology and lore to create a unique world called Aurioma. Its plotline and visuals are enrooted mainly in Cameroonian culture and art, but also in traditions found in many other African countries, such as Mali, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and even Egypt. Aurion is designed to acquaint the player with African ancient wisdom. The visuals – garments, landscapes, objects, and other in-game elements offer players colorful graphics, sceneries and characters that highlight African culture in its unique and fascinating diversity.  
The creators of Aurion borrow their game mechanics from JRPG (Japanese role-playing game) – a popular genre centered on adventures in a fantasy world. The original Japanese sceneries and myths have been replaced by African landscape and lore, creating a new aesthetics for adventure games.
