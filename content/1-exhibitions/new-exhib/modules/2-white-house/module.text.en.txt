This is the first exhibition of the Moroccan artist Aicha El Beloui in Israel. In a subtle, minimalist and pointed approach, with poignant and critical humor, she sketches the relations formed between the civilian and the urban space she occupies. Her feminist gaze poses a political, social and cultural perspective on Islamic society in Morocco, with emphasis on her hometown Casablanca.

El Beloui draws just like writing. Her drawings represent an interpretation of a moment, of a statement or an emotion, without any extra aesthetic weight. Her pencil touches are intimately personal and identified with her work. In her hands, cityscape becomes human figures who express pieces of information that she plants as in a sophisticated caricature.
