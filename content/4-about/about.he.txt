Text: The African Studies Gallery is an innovative and unique exhibition space. Located in the heart of Tel Aviv, the gallery strives to stimulate critical thinking and to challenge our conventional understanding of Africa as a cultural entity. Through exhibitions and cultural events we shall be seeking to present to the public the rich and varied cultures of Africa in the hope that the gallery and its activities will bridge people and cultures. The African Studies Gallery is not a commercial gallery, focusing instead on examining art, cultures and the way we view cultures that are different to our own, encouraging discussions, inquisitiveness and understanding. Each exhibition takes on a slightly different format, and often includes more than one artist focusing around a central theme or idea. The curatorship of the gallery aims to allow the general public, and not only those with extensive knowledge of African art and culture, an opportunity to access and be exposed to such wonderful heritages.
